Positive application performance : G2 Crowd is the best 3rd party validation platform for software companies. the platform is easy to use, but has all the data and features one might want from a review platform like G2. the best part is, of course, quarterly G2 award badges.

Negative reviews on application performance : the intent program is very expensive and it will be difficult to justify our ROI. the interfaces is a little "homebrew" - getting to admin center is a little clunky. the sales experience is frankly appalling and substandard.

Positive reviews on Bugs : the vendor portal is astronomically easy to use and offers great tools to analyze and get market intelligence. i love the platform and the way it helps us gain valuable feedback from our customers.

Negative reviews on Bugs : there are sometimes bugs on the admin side that prevent me from updating certain things right away, but those issues get addressed quickly by the G2 Crowd team. the biggest downside is not being able to incentivize reviews for non-subscribed products. this unfairly skews ratings and reviews across products.

Positive reviews on missing functionality : i've been using G2 for about a year and have seen great results in sales and marketing. the platform is a great way to collect honest reviews and showcase your product. the customer success team at G2 is a great resource for me and my team.

Negative reviews on missing functionality : i was about to say lack of Slack integration until Patrick showed me that they have built it in, and got us integrated. i wish there was more customization with the review questions and a way to provide ongoing feedback from customers that have posted reviews. i would recommend all who think about using G2 on a pro level invest a bit of their time learning what's in the admin panel.

Positive reviews on user experience : the platform is intuitive and easy to use. it's a great tool for identifying and understanding purchase intent. it's also a great tool for generating leads.

Negative reviews on user experience : some of the reports - especially around usability and ease of set-up - currently mitigate against larger vendors with more sophisticated solutions; these feel a little unfair. i am not a proponent of copy catting all the time.
